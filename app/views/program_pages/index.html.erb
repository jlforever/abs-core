			<h1>Chinese Mandarin Immersed Program</h1>
			<p>Our program is based on the principal that by letting kids fully immersed in a Chinese environment, they will be quickly picking up Chinese listening and communicative skills. We make the immersed program fun by having kids participate in fun games, addictive and rhythmic music and creative art projects. All materials will be included. We hope your child will join us on our exciting journey through language!</p><br/>
